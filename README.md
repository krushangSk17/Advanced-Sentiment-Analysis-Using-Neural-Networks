# Advanced-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Neural-Networks
a deep learning project for sentiment analysis, employing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including LSTM and GRU, using PyTorch. Task involved processing Amazon reviews for sentiment classification.

The project described in the document is a comprehensive assignment focusing on machine learning and natural language processing. It extends from a previous assignment and includes several key components:

1. **Dataset Generation**: Using the Amazon reviews dataset to create a balanced dataset of 100K reviews, with a training/testing split of 80%/20%.

2. **Word Embedding**: Implementing Word2Vec features using the Gensim library and analyzing semantic similarities.

3. **Simple Models**: Training a single perceptron and an SVM model using pre-trained Google Word2Vec features.

4. **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)**: Training a multilayer perceptron network with specific configurations and comparing accuracy values.

5. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Training different RNN models (simple RNN, GRU, LSTM) for sentiment analysis and comparing their performance.
